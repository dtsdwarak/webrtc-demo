# webrtc-demo
Demo app for WEBRTC

#Serving the app

```bash
$ npm start
```

#Viewing

The app will be served at [localhost:8001](http://localhost:8001). ```simplewebrtc.bundle.js``` needs to be configured to use a signalling server. You can either run a signal server in your machine by running [dtsdwarak/webrtc-signal](https://github.com/dtsdwarak/webrtc-signal) or use some free signalling server such as mine that runs on Heroku.

Alternately, you can deploy the same code to Heroku.
