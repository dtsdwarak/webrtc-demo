#Serving the app

$ node server.js
```

#Viewing

The app will be served at [localhost:8001](http://localhost:8001). ```simplewebrtc.bundle.js``` needs to be configured to use a signalling server. You can either run it in your custom server by running [dtsdwarak/webrtc-signal](https://github.com/dtsdwarak/webrtc-signal) or use some free signalling server.
